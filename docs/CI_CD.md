# CI/CD: Artifact Registry and Cloud Run

The repository deploys its Go API and generation worker to Google Cloud Run. Every push to `main` builds versioned container images, pushes them to Artifact Registry, runs database migrations, and rolls the "latest iteration" of both services onto Cloud Run as a new revision.

## Flow

1. GitHub Actions compiles the three release binaries on the runner, then builds three image targets from `apps/api/Dockerfile` with a single `docker buildx bake` over `docker-bake.hcl`. The images are `FROM scratch` and copy one binary each out of `dist/`, so the container carries no toolchain and the build is a `COPY`:
   - `api` (web server, port 8000) -> Cloud Run **service** `api`
   - `worker` (River queue consumer with a health server, port 8080) -> Cloud Run **service** `worker`
   - `migrate` (Goose + River migrations, one-shot) -> Cloud Run **job** `slidesage-migrate`
   - `mlflow` (generation trace and evaluation store) -> IAM-protected Cloud Run **service** `mlflow`
2. Each image is tagged with the full git commit SHA (e.g. `api:a1b2c3d...`) plus `latest` and pushed to Artifact Registry.
3. `terraform apply -target=google_cloud_run_v2_job.migrate` updates the migration job to the new image, then `gcloud run jobs execute` runs it against the database and waits.
4. A fresh full plan and `terraform apply` point the `api` and `worker` Cloud Run services at the SHA-tagged image. Cloud Run creates a new revision and routes 100% of traffic to it, which is the "latest iteration" seen by users. Previous revisions remain available by SHA for rollback.

After this testing bookmark is merged through dev into main and the documented bootstrap is complete, Terraform will own the Cloud Run services, the job, the load balancer, and supporting IAM. The currently deployed services were created with gcloud; no adoption has been applied from this bookmark. The workflow supplies only the image references, through `TF_VAR_api_image`, `TF_VAR_worker_image`, and `TF_VAR_migrate_image`. It needs the `TF_STATE_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` repository secrets alongside the existing workload-identity secrets. See [Production infrastructure](PRODUCTION_INFRASTRUCTURE.md).

Trigger: a push to `main` after the dev-to-main PR is merged, or a manual dispatch on `main`. Both jobs explicitly reject other refs, so dispatching from the testing bookmark cannot publish images or change production. All production runs share one concurrency group.

A complete plan runs before the targeted migration update. Missing secrets, missing Cloudflare DNS permissions, or invalid import IDs stop deployment before any Terraform apply. The first deployment also needs the state bucket, credentials, and imports described in [Production infrastructure](PRODUCTION_INFRASTRUCTURE.md).

## Build caching

A small change does not rebuild the whole stack. Two caches carry unchanged work between runs.

| Cache | Where | Key |
| ----- | ----- | --- |
| Go module and build cache, written | `checks.yml` | `apps/api/go.sum` hash plus the UTC date |
| Go module and build cache, read | `deploy.yml` build job | the same key, restore only |

`actions/setup-go` caching is off on purpose. It restores on an exact key match only, so a `go.sum` bump starts from nothing: the release that merged PR #43 spent 65s in `go test` and another 25s saving. `cache: false` plus an explicit `actions/cache` with `restore-keys` means a dependency bump falls back to the previous entry instead. On commits that do not touch `go.sum` the old behaviour was already fine, at roughly 3s, so this is insurance for the bump, not a saving on every run.

The release compiles against the entry the checks job wrote minutes earlier on the same commit, so the binaries build incrementally. Only `checks` writes; two jobs racing one key would be undefined.

### Why the keys carry a date

The Actions cache is 10 GB per repository and evicts by least recent access. The Go entry is about 265 MB, so keying it on the commit would write a new one on every run and churn the budget. A UTC date bounds writes to one per branch per day while `restore-keys` still falls back to the newest existing entry.

The save is skipped entirely on a pull request. A cache written by a `pull_request` run is scoped to that run's merge ref and can only be restored by a re-run of the same pull request, so it would never be read. Pull requests still restore from the base branch normally.

Cache scope is per branch throughout: a run reads its own branch, the default branch, and for a pull request its base. Entries written on `dev` are invisible to `main` and the reverse, so the `checks` job called by `deploy.yml` restores from previous `main` runs only.

### What is deliberately not cached

**Docker layers.** Each image is a `COPY` of one binary onto `scratch`, sharing only the certificate stage, so there is nothing left that a layer cache would save. A `.dockerignore` keeps the build context to `dist/`; without it the whole repository, `.git` and `node_modules` included, is uploaded to the builder for a build that reads three files.

**BuildKit cache mounts.** The binaries were once compiled inside the image behind `--mount=type=cache`. Layer cache and cache-mount contents are separate mechanisms and `type=gha` carries only the former, so those mounts started empty on every run. `buildkit-cache-dance` fixed that and was measured over two releases: a warm cache took the bake from 88s to 37s, but injecting and extracting cost 17s and 52s, so 69s of overhead bought 51s of compile. Compiling on the runner removes the problem instead of paying for it.

**Terraform providers.** `TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR` backed by `actions/cache` was tried and measured at net zero: fetching `hashicorp/google` and `cloudflare/cloudflare` from the registry took 2.45s, serving them from a restored cache took 0.5s, and restoring the 39 MB entry cost the 2s difference back. The plugin cache exists to share one download across several configurations, or to help on a slow or metered connection, and this repository has two providers, one working directory, and a runner with fast egress. It is also explicitly not concurrency safe, which would matter if the Terraform jobs were ever parallelised over a shared workspace.

Revisit that last one if the provider count grows past roughly five, more Terraform configurations are added, or CI moves to self-hosted runners. If the goal is ever independence from the registry rather than speed, use a provider mirror, which is deterministic, rather than a best-effort cache.

### Path filtering

A change confined to `apps/web` skips the Go test, vet, and build steps; a change confined to `apps/api` skips the type check, the TypeScript tests, and the web build; a change touching neither, such as documentation, skips both sets.

Anything that changes how a release is built or shipped is in both filters, not neither: `checks.yml`, `deploy.yml`, and `docker-bake.hcl`. A release whose only change is to the pipeline would otherwise report a green gate having run nothing, which is how the first run of this arrangement reached production.

This applies to pushes as well as pull requests. A pull request is diffed through the API against its base; a push is diffed against the commit the branch moved from, which requires that commit to be in the checkout, hence `fetch-depth: 50` on a push.

Every way of failing to resolve a base runs the whole suite: a first push to a new branch, a force push, a range deeper than the checkout, or an error inside the filter. A check that silently narrows itself is worse than one that occasionally does too much. The filtering also stays inside the single `test-and-build` job rather than splitting it, so the check name branch protection requires is always reported.

Cloudflare Pages has its own build cache enabled through `build_caching` in `infra/prod/edge.tf`, and `BUN_VERSION` is pinned there so a deployment builds on the same Bun the checks ran on rather than the older Pages default. Preview deployments are not pinned.

## Artifact Registry layout

Location is `asia-south1`, repository `slidesage`.

```text
asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/slidesage/api:<sha>
asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/slidesage/api:latest
asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/slidesage/worker:<sha>
asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/slidesage/worker:latest
asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/slidesage/migrate:<sha>
asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/<PROJECT_ID>/slidesage/migrate:latest
```

Cloud Run runs in `asia-south1`. Change `RUN_REGION` and `REGISTRY_LOCATION` in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` if you move regions.

The production API is served at `https://api.slidesage.app` through a global external HTTPS load balancer. Its reserved IPv4 address is `34.107.143.198`; the Cloudflare `api` record must be a DNS-only `A` record pointing to that address. Cloud Run custom domain mappings are unavailable in `asia-south1`, so the load balancer connects to the `api` service through the `slidesage-api-neg` serverless NEG.

Cloudflare Pages runs `bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build` from `apps/web`. Vite bundles the React application into `apps/web/dist`, handles route-level code splitting, processes Tailwind through `@tailwindcss/vite`, and copies static files from `apps/web/public`.

The Pages deployment copies `apps/web/public/_headers` into the build and sends `Cache-Control: no-cache` for the application and its assets. Do not add a Cloudflare Browser TTL or Cache Everything rule for `slidesage.app`. Pages manages its own CDN cache, and an extra zone cache can keep HTML from one deployment while its hashed JavaScript chunks come from another. The web entry point also listens for Vite's `vite:preloadError` event. If an open tab requests a chunk removed by a newer deployment, it reloads once to fetch the current HTML and then leaves any repeated failure to the route error page instead of entering a reload loop.

## One-time GCP bootstrap

Run these once with the account that owns the project. Set `PROJECT_ID` to `slidesage-504414` and `PROJECT_NUMBER` to the project number (see `gcloud projects describe $PROJECT_ID`).

```bash
PROJECT_ID=slidesage-504414
PROJECT_NUMBER=94621805506
REPO_URL=SINGH-RAJVEER/slidesage

gcloud services enable run.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com secretmanager.googleapis.com
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID

gcloud artifacts repositories create slidesage \
  --repository-format=docker \
  --location=asia-south1 \

```

The workflow signs in to GCP through Workload Identity Federation using short-lived OIDC tokens from GitHub, so no long-lived service account keys are stored anywhere.

The commands above describe the existing image-build and Cloud Run identity bootstrap. They are not a complete Terraform permission setup. Before adoption, authorize the CI identity to manage the resources in `infra/prod`, including Compute load balancing, Cloud SQL, Artifact Registry, service accounts, project services/IAM, Secret Manager IAM, and storage buckets/IAM. It also needs object access to the Terraform state bucket. Grant permissions at the narrowest supported scope through a separately approved IAM change; no permissions are granted by editing this repository.

Do not reduce the identity to the old service-scoped Cloud Run roles while expecting it to manage the full Terraform stack. Runtime service accounts remain separate from the deployment identity.

## GitHub repository setup

Create secrets in Settings -> Secrets and variables -> Actions:

| Secret                | Value                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `GCP_PROJECT_ID`      | `slidesage-504414`                                          |
| `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER`    | `projects/<PROJECT_NUMBER>/locations/global/workloadIdentityPools/slidesage/providers/github` |
| `GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` | `slidesage-deploy@slidesage-504414.iam.gserviceaccount.com` |
| `TF_STATE_BUCKET` | `slidesage-504414-tfstate`, after the versioned bucket exists |
| `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` | `1f4b64abf5ce89626a42b88a12d71cdc` |
| `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` | Token with Zone Read, DNS Read/Edit, and Pages Read/Edit |

API invocation policy is defined by `google_cloud_run_v2_service_iam_member.api_public_invoker`. The old `API_AUTH_FLAG` variable is no longer used. Application authentication still protects private routes.

## Secret Manager

`DATABASE_URL`, `AUTH_SECRET`, `RATE_LIMIT_HASH_SECRET`, OAuth credentials, `EXA_API_KEY`, `OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY`, `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL`, and `CDN_SIGNING_KEY_SECRET` are referenced by the pipeline and must exist as Secret Manager secrets (secret name + `:latest` version):

```bash
printf "postgresql://user:pass@.../slidesage" | \
  gcloud secrets create DATABASE_URL --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<32+ char random secret>" | \
  gcloud secrets create AUTH_SECRET --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<independent random secret>" | \
  gcloud secrets create RATE_LIMIT_HASH_SECRET --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<Google OAuth client ID>" | \
  gcloud secrets create GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<Google OAuth client secret>" | \
  gcloud secrets create GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<GitHub OAuth client ID>" | \
  gcloud secrets create GITHUB_CLIENT_ID --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<GitHub OAuth client secret>" | \
  gcloud secrets create GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<Exa API key>" | \
  gcloud secrets create EXA_API_KEY --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<OpenRouter API key>" | \
  gcloud secrets create OPEN_ROUTER_API_KEY --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<Resend API key>" | \
  gcloud secrets create RESEND_API_KEY --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<verified SlideSage sender on slidesage.app>" | \
  gcloud secrets create RESEND_FROM_EMAIL --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
```

Billing additionally needs the three Razorpay secrets. `terraform plan` fails with a "secret not found" error until all three exist:

```bash
printf "<Razorpay key ID>" | \
  gcloud secrets create RAZORPAY_KEY_ID --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<Razorpay key secret>" | \
  gcloud secrets create RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
printf "<Razorpay webhook signing secret>" | \
  gcloud secrets create RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET --data-file=- --project=$PROJECT_ID
```

Payments are not optional. Terraform lists these secrets unconditionally, and the API refuses to start if any value is absent. This prevents a deployment from booting with dead checkout or webhook endpoints.

Do not generate the Cloud CDN key independently from `CDN_SIGNING_KEY_SECRET`. Create one random 16-byte key, add its base64url value to the `templates` backend bucket under the configured `CDN_SIGNING_KEY_NAME`, then store that same value as a Secret Manager version. Google does not return the value after the CDN key is added. The current production key name is `templates-key-v2`.

The API deployment sets `BASE_URL=https://api.slidesage.app` and trusts `https://slidesage.app`, `https://www.slidesage.app`, and `https://slide-sage.pages.dev` for browser authentication callbacks. Configure the provider callback URLs as `https://api.slidesage.app/auth/callback/google` and `https://api.slidesage.app/auth/callback/github`.

`PRESENTATION_GCS_BUCKET`, `CDN_URL`, `CDN_SIGNING_KEY_NAME`, and `CDN_SIGNED_URL_TTL_SECONDS` reach the API and worker from `infra/prod/main.tf`. Change them there, not with `gcloud run deploy`: a direct deploy replaces the whole container specification and the next Terraform plan reverts it.

The Cloud SQL socket mount and the `roles/cloudsql.client` grant on the runtime service account are declared in `infra/prod`.

## Cloud Run service settings

| Service | Port | Instances     | Concurrency | Notes                       |
| ------- | ---- | ------------- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| `api`   | 8000 | min 0, max 10 | 80          | Scales from zero on traffic |
| `worker` | 8080 | min 0, max 10 | 1           | An authenticated Cloud Task owns the River client while work is active. |

The queue worker has no minimum instance and keeps CPU available while an instance exists (`cpu_idle = false`). After committing a River job, the API creates an authenticated Cloud Task that starts a worker and holds `/drain` open. River uses row-level `SKIP LOCKED`, so concurrent request-owned clients can claim jobs safely. Monitor queue latency, task dispatch, provider limits, and database connections together.

### Ingress and invocation

The deployment workflow pins each service's ingress instead of inheriting a mutable Cloud Run default:

| Resource            | Ingress                             | Invocation policy                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `api`               | `internal-and-cloud-load-balancing` | Public at the Cloud Run IAM layer by default because browsers and external webhooks call it; application authentication protects private routes. Internet traffic must pass through the external HTTPS load balancer. |
| `worker`            | `internal`                          | Private. Same-project Cloud Tasks invokes `/drain` as the runtime service account, which is the only identity with `roles/run.invoker`. There is no `allUsers` binding.                                              |
| `slidesage-migrate` | Not applicable                      | Cloud Run Job executed by the authenticated CI/CD identity. Jobs do not have service ingress settings.                                                                                                                |

The API ingress setting blocks direct internet requests to its `run.app` URL. It also makes the external load balancer the enforcement point for any attached Cloud Armor policy. Do not change the API to `ingress=all` while the load balancer is the documented production entry point.

After deployment, the workflow verifies both ingress values and fails if the worker has an `allUsers` invoker binding.

To bring existing services in line with the workflow without waiting for another deployment, run:

```bash
gcloud run services update api \
  --project=slidesage-504414 \
  --region=asia-south1 \
  --ingress=internal-and-cloud-load-balancing

gcloud run services update worker \
  --project=slidesage-504414 \
  --region=asia-south1 \
  --ingress=internal \
  --invoker-iam-check
```

The historical gcloud equivalent below is for manual recovery only. Normal releases update the job through Terraform and execute it with `gcloud run jobs execute`:

```bash
gcloud run jobs deploy slidesage-migrate \
  --project=slidesage-504414 \
  --image="$REGISTRY_LOCATION-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/$REGISTRY_REPOSITORY/migrate:$IMAGE_VERSION" \
  --region=asia-south1 \
	--service-account="slidesage-runtime@$PROJECT_ID.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
	--set-cloudsql-instances="$PROJECT_ID:$RUN_REGION:slidesage-postgres" \
  --set-secrets=DATABASE_URL=DATABASE_URL:latest \
  --execute-now \
  --wait
```

The CI identity needs both job update and execution permissions, alongside the Terraform permissions described above.

## Rollback

Every deploy is a Cloud Run revision pinned to an immutable SHA image, so rollback is instant:

```bash
gcloud run services update-traffic api \
  --region=asia-south1 \
  --to-revisions=api-20260810-1200=100

gcloud run services update-traffic worker \
  --region=asia-south1 \
  --to-revisions=worker-20260810-1200=100
```

or atomically in the console: Cloud Run -> service -> Revisions -> select revision -> Manage traffic.

## Manual equivalents

```bash
gcloud auth configure-docker asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev

# The images copy prebuilt binaries, so compile them first:
just binaries

# One image:
docker build --target api --file apps/api/Dockerfile --tag asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/api:dev .
docker push asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/api:dev

# Or all three, the way CI does:
PROJECT_ID=slidesage-504414 IMAGE_VERSION=dev docker buildx bake -f docker-bake.hcl --push
```

## Troubleshooting

- `403` pushing to Artifact Registry: re-run `gcloud auth configure-docker asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev` and confirm the service account has `roles/artifactregistry.writer`.
- `Permission 'iam.serviceAccounts.actAs' denied` during deploy: re-apply the `roles/iam.serviceAccountUser` binding.
- WIF auth step fails: confirm `GCP_WIF_PROVIDER`/`GCP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` match the pool that was created and that the binding uses the same `REPO_URL` casing as the repository.
- `error loading dynamically imported module` after a web deploy: confirm the failed `/assets/*.js` URL belongs to an older build, then check Cloudflare Cache Rules for a custom Browser TTL or Cache Everything rule and remove it. Pages should return `Cache-Control: no-cache` from `public/_headers`. Purge the zone cache once after removing the rule so cached SPA HTML is not served for missing asset URLs.

## Migration cutover

Every production release takes an on-demand Cloud SQL backup before running migrations. The backup starts as soon as the release job authenticates and runs alongside the Terraform planning, because nothing before the migration depends on it; the workflow blocks on its completion immediately before the schema changes, where the guarantee has to hold. It does not trust the exit status of `gcloud sql operations wait`, which documents a timeout and nothing about what it returns for an operation that finished with an error. The operation is read back and its status and error fields are checked, so a failed backup stops the release rather than letting it migrate without a recovery point. Terraform then sets the existing API and queue services to manual scaling with zero instances, preserving their previous images for this phase. This stops new submissions and queue processing while schema changes run. The API is temporarily unavailable during the cutover.

The full release apply restores automatic scaling with the new API and generation-worker images. If migration or release apply fails, services remain paused; inspect the failure before retrying rather than restarting an old binary against a changed schema.

Migration 25 deletes presentations without a committed PPTX revision, as required by the canonical-only transition. The backup preserves the pre-release database for recovery; it does not make the deletion reversible through a schema downgrade.
