# Production infrastructure

`infra/prod` defines the production Google Cloud and Cloudflare resources. These changes are prepared on the testing bookmark and must reach `dev`, then a merged `dev`-to-`main` PR before deployment. The workflow rejects non-main runs, including manual dispatches. Nothing in this branch has been applied.

The September 7, 2026 read-only audit found the existing infrastructure was created outside Terraform. There was no state bucket in the project and this checkout had no initialized backend. The workflow on this branch switches future main deployments to Terraform so direct `gcloud run deploy` calls cannot overwrite its configuration. Cloudflare Pages continues to build the frontend independently from GitHub.

Terraform does not create secret values. It reads existing Secret Manager secrets and grants the Cloud Run runtime service account access to them. When `otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint` is set, this includes the `DATADOG_OTLP_HEADERS` secret used for direct Datadog intake.

## Cloud SQL connectivity

The API, worker, and migration job connect through the Cloud SQL Unix socket at `/cloudsql/<project>:<region>:<instance>`. `DATABASE_URL` must use that socket path and be stored in Secret Manager. Create the application database role and rotate its password outside Terraform so credentials never enter Terraform state.

## Resources

- Artifact Registry repository `slidesage` in `asia-south1`
- Cloud Run service `api`, public only through the external HTTPS load balancer
- Cloud Run service `worker`, scaling from zero to ten instances, with CPU kept allocated while an instance is running. Public ingress with no `allUsers` binding: Cloud Tasks dispatches the wake signal from outside the project network, so IAM is what keeps the service closed
- Cloud Tasks queue `worker-wake`, carrying the signal that starts a worker after a submission commits
- Cloud Run job `slidesage-maintenance`, running `cmd/worker --maintenance` on a Cloud Scheduler trigger for recovery and cleanup
- Cloud Run job `slidesage-migrate`, invoked by deployment automation after an image update
- A single-zone Enterprise `db-f1-micro` Cloud SQL PostgreSQL 18 instance with 10 GB SSD storage, no automated backups, and no point-in-time recovery
- Global external HTTPS load balancer and serverless NEG for `api`, with an HTTP listener that redirects to HTTPS
- Cloud CDN backend bucket `templates`, routed from the `/pptx-templates/*` path rule on the `api` host and served from the private template-origin bucket
- Managed certificate for `api`, attached to the HTTPS proxy
- DNS-only Cloudflare `api` record pointing to the load balancer address
- Existing Cloudflare Pages project `slidesage` and its apex domain. The live Pages API does not list `www`; attaching it is outside this adoption.
- Private GCS bucket for immutable canonical presentation revisions
- Existing private template-origin bucket `slidesage-504414-templates`, read by the Cloud CDN cache-fill service account and routed under `https://api.slidesage.app/pptx-templates/`

Terraform creates the revision bucket and grants the Cloud Run runtime account bucket-scoped object creator and viewer access. It references the existing template-origin bucket and grants its Google-managed Cloud CDN cache-fill account object viewer access. Override `presentation_gcs_bucket` or `template_gcs_bucket` when the bucket names differ from their defaults.

Cloud CDN signing key material is deliberately outside Terraform because putting the shared key value in a resource would store it in Terraform state. Rotate keys with Google Cloud tooling, retain the base64url value in Secret Manager as `CDN_SIGNING_KEY_SECRET`, and set `cdn_signing_key_name` to the active key name. The API and worker receive the secret from Secret Manager. Never add the value to `terraform.tfvars` or a client build variable.

The API has `internal-and-cloud-load-balancing` ingress. Preserve the existing DNS-only API record and load balancer route. The URL map uses the live `api-matcher` name. The HTTPS proxy uses the API certificate.

Pages retains its live build command, `bun install --frozen-lockfile && bun run build`, build cache, and repository name `slide-sage`. That is the name the Pages API reports, while the local Git remote uses `slidesage`. Do not change the Git integration as a side effect of adoption.

## Bootstrap

Create the required Secret Manager secrets before the first plan. The names are listed in `infra/prod/main.tf`, and `data.google_secret_manager_secret` fails the plan for any name that does not exist. Payments are not optional, so the `RAZORPAY_*` secrets are listed alongside the rest. At minimum, production needs the values documented in [Environment variables](ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md). Use a dedicated Terraform service account with permission to manage Cloud Run, Artifact Registry, Compute load balancing, service accounts, Secret Manager IAM bindings, and the enabled services.

To enable Datadog, create `DATADOG_OTLP_HEADERS` before setting `otel_exporter_otlp_endpoint`:

```bash
gcloud secrets create DATADOG_OTLP_HEADERS --replication-policy=automatic
printf '%s' 'dd-api-key=<api-key>,dd-otlp-source=serverless,compute_stats=true' \
	| gcloud secrets versions add DATADOG_OTLP_HEADERS --data-file=-
```

Set `otel_service_version` to the deployed commit SHA, which CI passes as `TF_VAR_otel_service_version`. See [Observability](OBSERVABILITY.md) for endpoint selection, log duplication, and Datadog views.

The Cloudflare token needs Zone Read, DNS Read/Edit for `slidesage.app`, and Pages Read/Edit for the account. The audit token could read Pages and the zone but was denied DNS-record access. The API record is discovered by hostname and imported automatically; do not invent its ID or replace it with a create operation to bypass missing permissions.

After merge and approval to provision infrastructure, create the versioned GCS state bucket outside this configuration using the commands in `infra/prod/backend.hcl.example`. Use `slidesage-504414-tfstate` with prefix `prod` consistently. The configuration cannot create its own backend bucket.

Set up Application Default Credentials for local Terraform, or supply a short-lived `GOOGLE_OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN` from an authorized gcloud session. A gcloud login alone does not provide ADC. CI uses the credential file exported by `google-github-actions/auth`.

Before the first production run, configure `TF_STATE_BUCKET`, `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`, and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in GitHub, in addition to the existing GCP workload-identity secrets. The CI identity must have Terraform's resource-management permissions and access to the state bucket; the old Cloud Run deploy permissions alone are insufficient.

```bash
cd infra/prod
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
cp backend.hcl.example backend.hcl
# Replace every <commit-sha> with images already built for the release.
export TF_VAR_cloudflare_api_token="..."
terraform init -backend-config=backend.hcl
terraform validate
terraform plan -out=release.tfplan
# Review the complete plan. Applying is a separate production operation.
```

Keep `terraform.tfvars` out of version control if it includes values that do not belong in the example file.

## Deploying containers

Terraform expects immutable values for `api_image`, `worker_image`, and `migrate_image`. Pass the commit-tagged Artifact Registry images after CI has pushed them. Update the job, run it, then update the services.

```bash
terraform apply \
	-target=google_cloud_run_v2_job.migrate \
	-var="api_image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/api:$GITHUB_SHA" \
	-var="worker_image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/worker:$GITHUB_SHA" \
	-var="migrate_image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/migrate:$GITHUB_SHA"

gcloud run jobs execute slidesage-migrate \
	--project=slidesage-504414 \
	--region=asia-south1 \
	--wait

terraform apply \
	-var="api_image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/api:$GITHUB_SHA" \
	-var="worker_image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/worker:$GITHUB_SHA" \
	-var="migrate_image=asia-south1-docker.pkg.dev/slidesage-504414/slidesage/migrate:$GITHUB_SHA"
```

Run the migration job before releasing API and worker revisions that depend on the new schema.

The main-only workflow first plans the whole configuration, then applies the migration-job target and runs the job. It re-plans the full release after migrations succeed because the targeted apply changed state. Terraform updates the service images and configuration; gcloud only executes the migration job and reads deployment status. Merging this branch does not remove the bootstrap requirements above.

## Adopting an existing environment

This project's resources were originally created with the `gcloud` CLI, so the resource names in `edge.tf` follow that environment rather than a fresh Terraform naming scheme: the address is `slidesage-api-ip`, the backend service is `slidesage-api-backend`, the URL map is `slidesage-api-map`, the certificate is `slidesage-api-cert`, and the forwarding rules are `slidesage-api-http-rule` and `slidesage-api-https-rule`. Renaming any of these means replacing the resource, so leave them alone.

`infra/prod/imports.tf` adopts those resources into state. Run `terraform plan` and confirm the summary reports imports, additions, and in-place changes only. A plan that proposes a replacement or a destroy means a name or an argument no longer matches the live resource; fix the configuration rather than applying. Keep the import blocks until adoption has been verified.

Cloudflare Pages and apex imports use the configured account ID. The API DNS import looks up the existing A record using the zone and hostname. Import blocks can remain after adoption; Terraform skips addresses already in state.

Adoption is not a no-op release. The revision bucket, runtime bucket permissions, and registry reader binding are planned additions. The new application also needs revision/CDN environment variables, HTTP startup probes, worker EXA credentials, proxy-header handling, and Razorpay secret references. Those differences from the older live application are intentional and must be reviewed in the release plan. Existing Cloud SQL connector enforcement and migration retry settings are preserved.

The audit found `RAZORPAY_KEY_ID`, `RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET`, and `RAZORPAY_WEBHOOK_SECRET` absent. Create them and populate their values through an approved secret-management step before release. Terraform deliberately fails planning when required secrets are missing; it does not create empty secret versions or silently disable payments.
